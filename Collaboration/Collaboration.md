# Collaboration: The Critical Software Developer Skill

One of the most often overlooked software developments skills is the ability to collaborate effectively.  Projects of any reasonable size and complexity require teams of developers and not simply individual contributors to be successful and sustainable.  The ability of team members to communicate and collaborate is critical to their productivity, quality of product, and overall success.

## Team Communication
Being part of successful (and sometimes not so successful) software develop teams for a number of years, I have had the opportunity to participate in a lot of teams with all different types of dynamics.   Below are a list of behaviors that I've found helpful for improving team collaboration, communication, and productivity:

### Create a Psychologically Safe Environment
In order for a team to effectively collaborate, it's important for team members to feel comfortable suggesting ideas, questioning team processes, and challenging application design decisions.  Having an environment that is free from criticism, blame, and fear of failure encourages team members to participate in discussions and be engaged in improving the product and all facets of the development workflow.  In these types of discussions it is extremely important to encourage differing opinions and ideas.  Even if an idea isn't selected it should be considered and valued.  It's this diversity of ideas that generates innovation.  It's not possible to have this level of engagement if people don't feel safe to participate.

Impassioned discussion and debate about application designs, tool selection, and other decisions impacting the team are important.  One sign of an effective team is their ability to have impassioned and engaged discussions without those discussions becoming personal or negative.  

### Be Respectful
This seems like it should be simple and straight forward...  Of course we all want to be respectful of others, but I've seen this be a challenge on many teams.  It requires constant mindfulness of how you are interacting with others.  
- Listen to others and thoughtfully consider ideas and concerns.
- Be humble and provide positive constructive feedback on design or code reviews.
- Be kind when someone on the team makes a mistake.  Remember that you will also make mistakes.
- Respect boundaries.  We're all different and have all have different boundaries for working with others.  Be respectful of the boundaries of each of your team members. 

### Be Positive
Not everyone is alike and all teams have different personalities and dynamics.  However, it's up to the team members to make their interactions as positive and productive as possible.  How this is done will depend on the personality of each team member.  It's important to always be mindful of the impact you're having on team discussions.

```

If you're the type who naturally takes over discussions and can be overbearing, then it's important to be especially mindful of listening and encouraging others to provide their input.  On the other hand, if you're the type who is naturally quiet and has a difficult time speaking up and participating in the discussions, then you may need to intentionally try to be more actively engaged.

It's surprisingly important to be positive while engaging with your team (or anyone really).  This might sound a little cliche, but the words we use and the non-verbal ques we give have a profound impact on the way people perceive and react during discussions.  Saying something as simple as "No, I don't agree." is negative enough to give the impression that the decision is made and there is no room for further discussion, debate, or ideas.  It's a statement that can make the someone defensive and once that happens it is difficult to have a productive discussion.  Negativity is not conducive to brainstorming or problem solving. 

A more open response to communicate that you have differing ideas would be to say "That's an interesting idea, have you considered..."  That type of response leaves open the possibility of discussion and shows that you appreciate different thoughts and opinions while still conveying your concerns.  This way the others are much more likely to continue engaging in the discussion.

### Be Reliable
The bottom line here is to "show up".  Be on time to meetings, respond to emails and other messages in a timely fashion.  This lets people know that you value their time and effort.  There is always a balance that needs to be struck between time to focus and instantaneous response, but it's important to establish team norms for this. If your team values focus then it may be acceptable to take longer to respond to email and chat, however some teams place a high value on immediate feedback.  Establishing team norms about the expectations for responses can help minimize frustration and misunderstandings.

### Support Team Decisions
Sometimes the team may end up making a decision with which you don't agree.   Most decisions are not right or wrong, but rather shades of gray.  It's important to remember that you don't need to win all the debates, and shouldn't for the good of the team.  You need to decide when a decision is important enough to push strongly for it, or when you're more open to try ideas from others on the team. However, even if you don't completely agree with a decision, once it's made it is extremely important to be supportive of it. 

Avoid being passive aggressive just because you don't agree with the decision.  This would be doing things like:
- Proceeding with developing your own solution even after the decision was agreed upon.  
- Not volunteering to help implement the agreed upon solution.
- Constantly bringing up the same old issues with the agreed upon solution.
- Saying "I told you so."

Being passive aggressive like this sends the message that you're more interested in your own ideas than working with effectively as a team.  Everyone is more effective and productive if the team is more effective and productive.

### Be Helpful

### Minimize Unnecessary Collaboration
Even though collaboration is extremely important to the productivity of a team, done ineffectively it can lead to reduced productivity.  Collaboration is a good thing, so more of it is always better right?  Just like everything else in life, collaboration is good in moderation.  Collaborating on the right topics and with the right team members is critical to productivity.   It's really easy to slip into the trap of over-collaborating.  Here are some tips to avoiding over-collaboration:

Minimize and Focus Cross-Team Meetings
Fight FOMO
Skip or Leave Unproductive Meetings
