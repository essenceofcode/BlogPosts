# Collaboration: The Critical Developer Skill

One of the most often overlooked software developments skills is the ability to communicate and collaborate effectively.  Projects of any reasonable size and complexity require teams of developers and not simply individual contributors to be successful and sustainable.  The ability of the team to communicate and collaborate is critical to their productivity and project success.

## Team Communication
Tips for improved team communication.

### Create a Psychologically Safe Environment
Collaboration in software development involves working together to improve products for customers, overcoming obstacles, planning releases, improving team productivity, and a myriad of other day-to-day team tasks that are critical to overall productivity and operation.  

In order for a team to effectively collaborate, it's important for team members to feel comfortable suggesting ideas, questioning team processes, and challenging application design decisions.  Having an environment that is free from criticism, blame, and fear of failure encourages team members to participate in discussions and be engaged in improving their products and, more importantly, their work flow.  Differing opinions should be encouraged.  Even if an idea isn't selected it should be considered and valued.  It's this diversity of ideas that generates innovation.

Impassioned discussion and debate about application designs, tool selection, and other decisions impacting the team are critical to innovation and product quality.  One sign of an effective team is their ability to have impassioned and engaged discussions about their work without those discussions becoming personal or negative.  

### Be Positive and Engaged in Discussions
Not everyone is alike and all teams have different personalities and dynamics.  However, it's up to the team members to make their interactions as positive and productive as possible.  How this is done will vary by each team member.  It's is important to always be mindful of the impact you're having on team discussions and work.  "Employees who feel their voice is heard are 4.6 times more likely to feel empowered to perform their best work." - [forbes.com](https://www.forbes.com/sites/nazbeheshti/2019/01/16/10-timely-statistics-about-the-connection-between-employee-engagement-and-wellness/#349d19fe22a0)

If you're the type who naturally takes over discussions and can be overbearing, then it's important to listen and encourage others to provide their input.  On the other hand, if you're the type who is naturally quiet and has a difficult time speaking up and participating in the discussions, then you may need to intentionally try to be more actively engaged.

It's surprisingly important to be positive while engaging with your team (or anyone really).  This might sound a little cliche, but the words we use and the non-verbal ques we give have a profound way on the way people perceive and react during discussions.  Saying something as simple as "No, I don't agree." is negative enough to give the impression that the decision is made and there is no room for further discussion or debate.  It's also a statement that can make the other person defensive and once that happens it is not conducive to brainstorming or problem solving. 

A better way to communicate differing ideas that would still leave open the possibility of discussion and understanding differing viewpoints would be to say "That's an interesting idea, have you considered..."  This still conveys the concerns you had about the original idea, but in a much more positive, open, and discussion promoting way.  This way the other person is much more likely to continue engaging in the discussion.

### Be Reliable
The bottom line here is to "show up".  Be on time to meetings, respond to emails and other messages in a timely fashion.  This lets people know that you value their time and effort.  There is always a balance that needs to be struck between time to focus and instantaneous response, but it's important to establish team norms for this. That way everyone knows the expectations.  

### Support Team Decisions
Sometimes the team may end up making a decision with which you don't agree.   Most decisions are not right or wrong, but rather shades of gray.  It's important to remember that you don't need to win all the debates, and shouldn't for the good of the team.  You need to decide when a decision is important enough to you to push strongly for it, or when it's not and you can try ideas from others on the team. However, even if you don't completely agree with a decision, once it's made it is extremely important to be supportive of it. 

Avoid being passive aggressive just because you don't agree with the decision.  This would be doing things like:
- Proceeding with developing your own solution even after the decision was agreed upon.  
- Not volunteering to help implement the agreed upon solution.
- Constantly bringing up the same old issues with the agreed upon solution.
- Saying "I told you so."

Being passive agressive like this 
You need to be able to tell when a particular decision is important enough to take a strong stand.
Don't be passive aggressive.  Support the team decision even if you don't agree with it.
Don't get hung up on the small things

### Be Helpful

### Minimize Unnecessary Collaboration
Even though collaboration is extremely important to the productivity of a team, done ineffectively it can lead to reduced productivity.  Collaboration is a good thing, so more of it is always better right?  Just like everything else in life, collaboration is good in moderation.  Collaborating on the right topics and with the right team members is critical to productivity.   It's really easy to slip into the trap of over-collaborating.  Here are some tips to avoiding over-collaboration:

Minimize and Focus Cross-Team Meetings
Fight FOMO
Skip or Leave Unproductive Meetings 

### Small Teams
